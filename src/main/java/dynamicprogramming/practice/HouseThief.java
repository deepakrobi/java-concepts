/**
 * There are n houses built in a line. A thief wants to steal the maximum possible money from these houses. The only
 * restriction the thief has is that he canâ€™t steal from two consecutive houses, as that would alert the security system
 * How should the thief maximize his stealing?
 *
 * Problem Statement
 *
 * Given a number array representing the wealth of n houses, determine the maximum amount of money the thief can steal
 * without alerting the security system.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: {2, 5, 1, 3, 6, 2, 4}
 * Output: 15
 * Explanation: The thief should steal from houses 5 + 6 + 4
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: {2, 10, 14, 8, 1}
 * Output: 18
 * Explanation: The thief should steal from houses 10 + 8
